## HTML Project Idea
### Create a portfolio using html
1. Open a text editor (for example, Notepad++)
2. Save file with the html extension (for example, my-portfolio.html)
3. Include the following:
  * headings
  * paragraphs
  * lists
  * links
  * images
4. View it in a browser
5. Verify it follows standards  with the [W3 validator](http://validator.w3.org)

Remember to implement current **HTML standards** and to consider **usability** and **accessibility** in your design!
If you want to keep working on your porfolio, you may want to check out CSS.
